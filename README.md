# traffic-control-system

Tried implementing the low level design for a Traffic Control System
## Requirements
1. The system must be able to monitor traffic flow in a region and adjust traffic signals to optimize traffic flow.
2. The system must be able to collect data from traffic sensors and use this data to make decisions about how to adjust traffic signals.
3. The system must be able to communicate with traffic signals and other devices in the traffic control system.
4. The system must be able to display information to drivers and pedestrians about the status of traffic signals and other traffic conditions.
5. The system must be able to operate in a variety of weather conditions.

## Components
Taking some of the feasible requirements, the components that come to my mind are:
1. Controller - responsible for monitoring and adjusting the traffic lights accordingly
2. Operator - type of operator like electric, solar, battery, etc.
3. Traffic Lights - responsible for displaying appropriate traffic lights for drivers
4. Devices - responsible for collecting data about the traffic flow. There can be multiple devices, such as Sensors, Cameras, etc.
